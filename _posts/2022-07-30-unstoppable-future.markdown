We cannot stop the future from happening.

The future will not be anything like the past.

Zoom out far enough, even just a few hundred years and notice the pace of innovation rapidly ramping up. Presumably, we're starting to reach the beginning of the knee in the exponential curve.

Is there a spot for humanity in the future? Probably not. –– and I'm an optimist.

We cannot even begin to fathom the transformation on the verge of occurring. I previously, up until just a few years ago, didn't believe that machines could ever be smarter than humans –– **boy was I wrong**.
